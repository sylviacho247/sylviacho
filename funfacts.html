<h1>Fun Facts (You Never Knew You Needed)</h1>
<ul>
  <li>🏔️ I spent my early childhood in Banff, Alberta — a tiny town nestled in the Canadian Rockies, full of elk, tourists, and accidental linguistic fieldwork. As <b>the only ethnically Korean kid in my grade</b> and surrounded by visitors speaking dozens of languages, I became keenly aware of how language shapes the way we sound — an awareness that now fuels my work as a linguist. (I also got very good at explaining Korea to confused classmates.)</li>
  <br>
  <li>🍓 I spent most of my upbringing in BC’s Fraser Valley — aka the berry capital of the province — where my summers were fueled by an unshakable ambition to become <b>the fastest berry picker</b> west of the Rockies. I didn’t break any speed records, but I did eat a concerning number of blueberries on the job.</li>
  <br>
  <li>⛸️ I’m a proud Canadian from the Rockies, but I have a confession: <b>I’m *terrible* at ice skating, skiing, snowboarding, tobogganing… </b> basically all winter sports. I’ve accepted that my true talents lie indoors — with language data and hot chocolate.</li>
  <br>
  <li>🗣️ Out of four siblings, I’m the only one who can <b>fluently speak, read, write, and understand Korean</b>. I never brag about it at family dinners... but I do feel a *quiet* sense of pride when I read academic linguistics papers in Korean like it’s no big deal.<br>
  <br>
  <li>✈️ <b>I didn’t own a passport until after undergrad.</b> Turns out, you don’t really need one if you never leave the North American continent! I finally got my very first passport to study in Korea for my master’s, where I dove headfirst into the language, food, and culture my parents grew up with.</li>
  <br>
  <li>🦅 I have <b>a deep love for Canadian Indigenous languages</b> and include them in almost every course that I teach. They’re not only beautiful and complex, but also powerful vessels of culture, history, and resilience. And yes, I absolutely geek out over their rich consonant inventories, which often feature ejectives, uvulars, and fascinating contrasts like plain vs. glottalized vs. labialized voiceless plosives.</li>
  <br>
  <li>🧸 Last but certainly not least, I’m <b>a very proud aunt</b> to the *cutest* nephew and niece. They speak only English, yet somehow understand all the Korean their grandparents throw at them — like tiny secret agents decoding grandparent code. Watching them acquire speech and language has been a linguist’s dream come true... basically live fieldwork, but with more snacks and cuter participants.</li>
