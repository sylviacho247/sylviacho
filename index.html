      <p>I am a PhD candidate and Sessional Instructor in the Department of Linguistics at Simon Fraser University, located on the traditional territories of the Coast Salish peoples in British Columbia. My research explores how multilingualism shapes speech across linguistic, social, and acoustic dimensions. Specifically, I investigate how bilingual and heritage speakers—such as Korean-Canadians in Vancouver—modulate their voice and articulation depending on the language they're speaking, and how these shifts are perceived within a broader sociolinguistic context.
        My work is grounded in experimental phonetics and acoustic analysis, drawing on multilingual speech data and perception tasks to examine how voice quality, vowel space, and prosodic cues interact with identity and language experience. I am particularly interested in how multilingual speakers contribute to the evolving soundscape of Canadian English, participating in or resisting ongoing sound changes.

In addition to my research, I am deeply invested in teaching and outreach. I regularly teach courses on speech science and introductory linguistics, where I aim to make phonetics accessible and engaging for students of all backgrounds. I view linguistics not only as a scientific discipline, but as a lens through which we understand the complexities of identity, culture, and communication.
