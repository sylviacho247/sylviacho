      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am a <b>PhD candidate</b> and <b>Sessional Instructor</b> in the Department of Linguistics at <b>Simon Fraser University</b>, located on the traditional territories of the Coast Salish peoples in British Columbia. <br><br> My research explores how multilingualism shapes speech across linguistic, social, and acoustic dimensions. Specifically, I investigate how bilingual and heritage speakers—such as Korean-Canadians in Vancouver—modulate their voice and articulation depending on the language they're speaking, and how these shifts are perceived within a broader sociolinguistic context.
        My work is grounded in experimental phonetics and acoustic analysis, drawing on multilingual speech data and perception tasks to examine how voice quality, vowel space, and prosodic cues interact with identity and language experience. I am particularly interested in how multilingual speakers contribute to the evolving soundscape of Canadian English, participating in or resisting ongoing sound changes.

<br><br>In addition to my research, I am deeply invested in teaching and outreach. I regularly teach courses on speech science and introductory linguistics, where I aim to make phonetics accessible and engaging for students of all backgrounds. I view linguistics not only as a scientific discipline, but as a lens through which we understand the complexities of identity, culture, and communication.

            <h2>Fun facts about me</h2>
<ul>
  <li>🏔️ I grew up in Banff, Alberta—a tiny town of about 5,000 people when I was growing up, nestled in the Canadian Rockies and full of elk, tourists, and linguistic inspiration. In Banff, I was the only ethnically Korean kid in my grade, which made me hyper-attuned to how heritage languages shape our voices and identities.</li>
  <li>🗣️ Out of four siblings, I’m the only one who can fluently speak, read, write, and understand Korean.</li>
  <li>✈️ I didn’t own a passport until after undergrad—turns out, you don’t need one if you never leave the continent! I finally got my very first passport to study in Korea for my master’s and dive headfirst into the language, food, and culture my parents grew up with.</li>
  <li>🌍 I have a deep love for Canadian Indigenous languages (and include them in almost every course I teach)—they’re not just beautiful and complex, but powerful vessels of culture, history, and resilience. I’m always in awe of how each one carries a unique worldview (and yes, I absolutely geek out over their rich consonant inventories, which often include ejectives, uvular sounds, and glottalized consonants).</li>
